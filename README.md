ML model predicting the probability of providing a loan

## Project Intro/Objective
The project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of a customer being approved for a loan based on their specific characteristics. This model is designed to be used directly by the customer to assess their eligibility for a loan before they apply. By inputting their relevant data into the model, the customer will receive a personalized probability score indicating their likelihood of a loan approval. Based on a Kaggle dataset.
